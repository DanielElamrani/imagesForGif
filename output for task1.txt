
output for task 1. 

Commands:
head -- to show first n number of lines
cut -- to trim the csv columns to just the song name and artist. 
If necessary we can sort the below output using the sort command: sort -t, -k1 (this sorts alphabetically using ',' as delimiter and column 1 as the column to sort by)
Though this would defeat the purpose of the report which is to just show the top 20 songs and artists in order.
